# Vega data nodes

This is a repository for maintaining data about well known entities to the Vega community, and can be used for clients and users to discover and connect to data nodes.

Data nodes provide a service by exposing read only APIs built on top of the Vega platform.

Data nodes provide the following core features:

- Consume all events from [Vega](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega) core
- Aggregates received events and stores the aggregated data
- Serves stored data via [APIs](https://docs.vega.xyz/mainnet/api/overview)
- Allows advanced configuration [Configure a node](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/tree/develop/datanode#configuration)
